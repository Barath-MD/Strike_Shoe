# **AI-Powered Intelligent System for the Early Detection of Foot Ulcers in Diabetic Patients**
## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
> * Diabetes Patients are prone to foot infection due to lack of proper bloodflow , delayed recovery rate leading to Foot ulcer(unrecovered wound) leading to amputation of led fingers in worst care scenarios.
> * This project is focused on providing _**predctive alert and primary care measures**_ for patients who use _**shoes regularly**_ for detecting foot ulcer earlier. 
> * We used a combination of _**Gen AI**_(to provide primary care measures) and _**IoT**_(to acquire data from user) to produce a solution to detect the foot ulcer earlier to take precautions along with some care measures from Generative AI via _**pipeline**_ call.
> * A combination of sensors will be incorperated with the patient's shoes which will collect the data from the foot (ie Pressure(more than one points), Temperature and Humidity[to detect sweating])
> * Based on the data ,the output **(SNN Model - Binary result**) will be generated by our AI model and it will ask the user for other questions _**1)fixed questions are asked**_  and **2)direct text feedback** from user to improve the model for the user specifications
> * The final _**primary care measures**_ will be given by the AI model to the user .

## Folders

+ The **application** folder contains the application file for the app to be downloaded by the user.

+ The **IOT_code** folder contains the code for esp32 development board for the sensor data collection in the users shoes.

+ The **jupyter_notebooks** folder contains the jupyter notebook code for AI model and code for synthetic datasets.
## Steps Involved
### IoT && ML Workflow
* 1)Esp32 based module collects data from shoe of the person
* 2)Data is pushed to thingspeak IoT cloud using API [Cloud Dashboard](https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/channels/2683036)
* 3)The data in cloud is accessed by [ml_v1]([jupyter_notebooks\ml_v1.ipynb](https://github.com/MUTHUNITHIN/Project_oneAPI_hack_kpr/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/ml_v1.ipynb))  [jupyter_notebooks\ml_v1.ipynb] , analyse with recent data and display the results and data in the app
* 4)The primary purpose of the app ( developed with Unity Engine ) is to serve as Dashboard for enduser
* 5)Also provide warnings(High Pressure critical condition)and alerts(priliminary conditions) when healthy condition is not met
### GenAI Workflow
* 6)The App is employed to acquire user feedback as Fixed Parameters and Text input from user
* 7)The fixed parameters are used as input for [GenAI_feedback](https://github.com/MUTHUNITHIN/Project_oneAPI_hack_kpr/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/GenAI_feedback.ipynb) [jupyter_notebooks\GenAI_feedback] second model[Linear Regression] capable of sending result oof second model's result along with users input to GPT Model
* 8)The gpt model will send some primary measures to prevent infection which is of _**selfcare type only** _

## Future works(works to be improved and persisting problems)
  + Adaptive model due to variation of data in each user(A 100kg persons foot pressure is more compared to another person with a weight of 80 kg )
  + Improved dashboard functionality and improved app
  + Optimizing gen_ai feedback code to be more functional and reliable
